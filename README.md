# Swivy

Swivy is an opinionated project starter for Flutter applications.
By "opinionated", we mean that the codebase is not highly configurable
for a wide variety of use cases; it will make certain assumptions about
authentication, dependencies, and UX that may or may not work for you.

Features & benefits of this starter will be listed here as they are developed.
