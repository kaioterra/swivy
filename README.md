# Swivy

Swivy is an opinionated project starter for Flutter applications.
By "opinionated", we mean that the codebase is not highly configurable
for a wide variety of use cases; it will make certain assumptions about
authentication, dependencies, and UX that may or may not work for you.

## Features
Features & benefits of this starter will be listed here as they are developed.

* Example implementation of the BLoC pattern using
  [`flutter_bloc`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_bloc).
* Use of [`Equatable`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/equatable) to reduce boilerplate code for equality checking.
* Use of [`meta`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/meta) annotations like
  `@immutable` for better static analysis.
